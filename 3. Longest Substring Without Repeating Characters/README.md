# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)


## Solution

```
indext    0    1    2    3   4   5   6   7
string    a    c    b    d   b   a   c   d
          ^                  ^
          |                  |
		left               right
		seen = {a : 0, c : 1, b : 2, d: 3} 
		# case 1: seen[b] = 2, current window  is s[0:4] , 
		#        b is inside current window, seen[b] = 2 > left = 0. Move left pointer to seen[b] + 1 = 3
		seen = {a : 0, c : 1, b : 4, d: 3}

				       left    right		
		# case 2: seen[a] = 0,which means a not in current window s[3:5] , since seen[a] = 0 < left = 3 
		# we can keep moving right pointer.
